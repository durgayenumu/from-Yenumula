# Venkata Durga Yenumula
My favourite food is Prawn Biryani. It is very yum and delicious. Prawn biryani is a delectable South Asian dish that combines succulent prawns with fragrant basmati rice. This aromatic dish often features a medley of ingredients such as onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger, infused with saffron and garnished with fresh cilantro and fried onions.
